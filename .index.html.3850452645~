       <p style="font-size:19px;"> <b>Medicaid and Medicare are different.</b>  you may benefit from Medicare if you are 65+ (under 65 too if you meet certain conditions) and have a disability, no matter your income. Meanwhile, Medicaid is a state and federal program that provides health coverage if you have a very low income.

         <br></br>
         
Although Medicaid caters to various healthcare needs, some services might entail minimal co-payments. Participants can access covered services using their Medicaid card, and those enrolled in managed care will receive services through their managed care plan. Essentially, Medicaid aims to provide crucial medical support to individuals facing financial challenges in US states. </p> <br>

      <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/unemployed/" target="_blank" class="tsect">healthcare options for unemployed</a>
        <p style="font-size:19px;"> 
          If you find yourself unemployed, there are health coverage options available to you. The Marketplace offers affordable health insurance plans where the costs are adjusted based on your income and the size of your household. Programs such as Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) might allow you to qualify for free or low-cost coverage.
          
          Moreover, your eligibility and the amount of assistance you receive in paying for coverage are determined by other factors excluding <b>your current employment status.</b> </p> <br>
